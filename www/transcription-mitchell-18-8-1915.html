Gallipoli 
18th August 1915

My dear father, I have been at the war now for nearly a fortnight. I am quite well having received no other injury than a slight wound on my knee, through being struck with a piece of shrapnel while outside my dug-out. It did not affect me much at the  time, but a cut of any kind is hard to heal in this climate and now I have it painted with iodine every day. The flies are the chief worry, and are the cause of much disease.

All letters that we write are supposed to deal with private and personal matters only, and it is hard for one to know how much to say and what constitutes private etc matters. I wish I could tell you of the awful reception we got but no doubt you have seen the names of the killed and wounded of the 5ths in the paper long ere this. Of 9 sergeants 2 of us are left on duty. When we got here there were no vacancies for us and we all reverted to the ranks automatically. I was promoted again to corporal a day or two back but for my own part I would sooner be in the ranks and free from worry. Nobody wants stripes here and they have to be forced on men, whether fit to hold them or not.

Our officers are all good men with plenty of experience behind them. I have not had a shave for several days and officers and men have good growths. On seeing a man for the first time it is hard to tell whether he is 40 or 20. The sea is only a short distance away but it is just 12 days since I washed. We are all very dirty. Paper is terribly scarce and we only get two pieces a week or so. The boys write on cigarette cases etc. Wish Lexy many happy 22nds for me please, even though it be a month or so late. I would like to write to all at home. A

letter for each one, but no envelopes and no paper make it impossible, so this must do for all. I am sending you a field service post card which is about as non-committal as a card could be. The boys don’t care much for them. Farra[?]2 as came over with us is still in Egypt and I do not think he is coming over for a while. Young Chris Fletcher3 and a fellow named Harling4 (a nephew of Mrs Carvers) are both well. They are the only Onehunga boys I can find. Did you receive my letters and diary which I gave to Billy Loveridge5 at Suez? Ernie Sutherland6 is not back here yet so far as I know, but I suppose he will be over soon. I forgot to say that Peter Brady is still alive & kicking. Peter is in my section and a good worker. Our chief worries here are lack of sleep and a constant shortage of water but we are at war and have to grin and bear our troubles.

I hope that you, Mama and all my sisters and Paul are keeping well and are quite happy. Don’t worry about me. I am but one in hundreds of thousands in the Great War.
Your loving son, 
Bert.

Just address me as before.
