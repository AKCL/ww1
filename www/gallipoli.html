        <div class="label">Ellis Luciano Silas joined the A.I.F. (Australian Imperial Force) as a signaller with the 16th Battalion on 16 October 1914. He had a strong sense of patriotism but was doubtful about his abilities as a soldier. After training at Heliopolis in Egypt, he went ashore at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.
        <br><br>
        He had studied art in England, and continued to sketch and write a diary. In his preface he wrote: 
        <em>“In this work I have not touched upon the big historical facts, but have endeavoured to portray War as the soldier sees it, shorn of all its pomp and circumstance; the War that means cold and hunger, heat and thirst, the ravages of fever; the War that brings a hail of lead that tears the flesh and rends the limb, and makes of men, heroes.”</em>
        <br><br>
        Constant exposure to heavy fire caused Silas to suffer from shell-shock, and on 17 May he was evacuated and sent to England to convalesce. He was discharged from the A.I.F. on 17 August 1916.</div>

        <div class="label">Norman Wilkinson was a British artist. During the First World War, while serving in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, he was assigned to submarine patrols in the Dardanelles, Gallipoli and Gibraltar, and left a unique record of his time spent on different ships.
        <br><br>
The allies had an advantage over the Ottomans in being able to bring large guns to bear from their battleships. As the trenches were often so close together, this sometimes led to shells falling on the wrong side of the front line. With the entrance of Bulgaria into the war on the side of the Central Powers, a railway was constructed whereby large guns from Germany could quickly be sent to the Turks fighting at Gallipoli. The prospect of this was another reason leading to the evacuation of the peninsula.</div>

        <div class="label">In 1914, at the age of about 46, Horace Moore-Jones enlisted in the British Section of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. To gain acceptance he shaved off his moustache, cropped his hair and lied about his age. He was subsequently attached to Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood's Anzac Printing Section to make pencil and watercolour sketches of the landscape and plans of Allied and enemy positions. In November 1915 he received a wound in his right hand which put a temporary end to his work. His health deteriorated and he was classified unfit for battle duty and repatriated to New Zealand.
        <br><br>
        His Gallipoli watercolours were shown in Auckland and later toured New Zealand. Thousands attended the exhibitions and heard his talks about the Gallipoli campaign. Many prints were made and sold to the public.

In this letter he writes about his time at Gallipoli, with universal soldiers’ complaints such as lack of mail and food. He describes some of the work carried out digging tunnels to stay safe from the large German guns, and sniping at the enemy, as well drawing a map of the Anzac enclave:
<em>“The night before I was in my post in the trenches, and the night before that again I was digging on a sap running up to the Apex and the Turkish position.”</em>
