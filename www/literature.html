     When we think today of First World War literature, the bitter anti-war poems of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfrid Owen probably come quickest to mind. During the war, however, many publishers preferred heroic tales from the battlefields intended to inspire a hopeful, patriotic attitude in readers. This was especially true of literature aimed at a juvenile audience. Scottish journalist Donald Alexander Mackenzie was a prolific compiler of children’s non-fiction books in the early decades of the twentieth century. He followed the stirring volume shown here with a similarly themed sequel, 
		<em>From all the fronts</em>, which appeared in 1917.

     First published in the British weekly newspaper <em>The nation</em> on 17 October 1914, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson’s poem “Breakfast” was one of the first literary works to comment on the grim realities of trench warfare. He included it, with other stark, hard-hitting poems, in his 1915 collection 
		<em>Battle</em>, which was reprinted several times and profoundly influenced such later war poets as Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Wilfred Owen. Gibson was not himself a soldier when he wrote 
		<em>Battle</em>, but he had talked to those with first-hand experience. He later served as a private in the Army Service Corps Motor Transport.

     Australian poet Clarence James Dennis wrote rollicking comic verse in a style similar to Banjo Paterson’s. He introduced his most famous creation, loveable larrikin Ginger Mick, as a supporting character in his 1915 verse novel 
		<em>The songs of a sentimental bloke</em>. Its sequel, 
		<em>The moods of Ginger Mick</em>, published the following year, was intended as a tribute to Anzac soldiers killed in the Dardanelles. After enlisting, Mick trains with his cobbers in Egypt and fights with distinction at Gallipoli, but he does not survive the campaign. Popular on both sides of the Tasman, the book sold more than 70,000 copies between 1916 and 1920.

     John Alexander Lee’s early years in Dunedin were blighted by poverty and petty crime. He had served time in borstal and prison before enlisting in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in March 1916. He proved a brave and resourceful soldier. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal in June 1917 for single-handedly capturing a German machine-gun post at Messines. The following March he was so severely wounded at Mailly-Maillet that his left forearm had to be amputated. After the war he became renowned throughout New Zealand as an orator, politician and author. His 1937 novel 
		<em>Civilian into soldier</em> draws extensively on his wartime experiences.

     Otago farmer Archibald Baxter became a convert to pacifism in the early years of the twentieth century. When military conscription was introduced to New Zealand in November 1916, he was at first incarcerated with others of a like mind in a special compound at the Trentham training camp but later sent to the Western Front, where he was treated brutally by unsympathetic officers. His memoir records how small acts of kindness by ordinary New Zealand soldiers helped to sustain him. His elder son, Terence, was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the Second world War. His younger son was the poet James K. Baxter.

     Rupert Brooke was already well-known in English literary circles for his striking good looks and poetic talent when the First World War began. The idealistic poems he wrote in the early months of the month, however, greatly increased his fame with the general public. Among the first to enlist, he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant in August 1914 and took part in the unsuccessful Antwerp expedition. While sailing to Gallipoli with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, he contracted sepsis from an infected mosquito bite and died on 23 April 1915.

    Kathleen Beauchamp – better known by her pen-name Katherine Mansfield – grew up in an affluent Wellington household. Disdainful of limited provincial life, she sailed to London in July 1908, at age 19, and never returned to her homeland. The accidental death of her beloved younger brother Leslie – killed by a defective grenade in October 1915 during a training session at Aldershot, Hampshire – affected her deeply. She began to write about her Wellington days, tempering her earlier scorn with nostalgia for what she now regarded as a peaceful idyll. One of the most famous of her New Zealand-based stories, 
	<em>The prelude</em>, was first printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press in 1918 under difficult wartime restrictions on paper.

    After studying medieval history at Oxford University, Thomas Edward Lawrence became an archaeologist in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt. When the war began he joined the British intelligence office in Cairo. With his fluency in Arabic and knowledge of the terrain, he was asked to help facilitate the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. First published in 1926, with some editing by Lawrence’s friend George Bernard Shaw, 
	<em>Seven pillars of wisdom</em> mixes an account of his wartime adventures with reflections on military strategy and Arab culture.
