			The red lines on the map mark the limits of the movements of the armies throughout the duration of the war. The dotted line is the furthest German advance. The unbroken line is the front in November 1918 at the armistice. The concentration of lines in the north, near the English Channel, centres on the Belgian town of Ypres (Ieper). The village of Passchendaele is nearby. The Somme battlefield is south of Arras.
