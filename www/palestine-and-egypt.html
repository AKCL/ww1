     Horses were shipped in great numbers from both Australia and New Zealand, more than 10,000 from New Zealand alone. It was soon found they were of little use at Gallipoli, so they were sent back to Cairo. When the rest of the New Zealand Division sailed for France in April 1916, the horses remained behind and were assigned to the new Anzac Mounted Division. They were more successful in the Middle East due to the mobile nature of the campaigns. However, only four horses were returned to New Zealand at the end of the war.

     Frank Hurley joined the Australian Imperial Force as an honorary captain in 1917 and produced many stunning photographs from the Middle East as well as the Western Front. He was an early experimenter with colour, which he had previously used during his time as official photographer on Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. These images show the type of terrain the Anzac troops were fighting in.

    The official war history of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment says:<br><br>
    <em>“The lines of the camp had been laid down with commendable foresight. Broad streets intersected the various unit areas, to which they gave access and facilitated the distribution of supplies. A water-supply system was installed throughout the camp; canteens, cinemas, and shower baths were erected, and separate areas were leased on rentals to tradespeople to ply their various callings. In short, a thickly-populated town sprang into being in a few days where a barren desert had previously existed.”</em>
