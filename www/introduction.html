With the exception of a few literary works published after the war, everything in the exhibition was produced between 1914 and 1919. This is what New Zealanders were reading and looking at as the war continued. </div>

            When Britain declared war on Germany and its Allies on 4 August 1914, the Dominions of the British Empire, including New Zealand, joined in with patriotic enthusiasm. Many thought the war would not last long and that it would be over by Christmas.  By the time the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, four years had passed and over 100,000 men had served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.</div>
