         <div class="label">Percival Morganti was born and brought up in Reefton on the West Coast. He served on the Western Front.
        The tickets, flyers, programmes and cuttings kept by Percy held memories for him which we cannot know. But we can trace his war through them in combination with his military personnel record. <br><br>
        All the items shown in this case come from the Morganti family papers (NZMS 1212) <br><br>
        The photograph in Percy’s paybook is of his brother Charles Victor, who was reported Missing in September 1916. In April the following year he was declared Killed in Action by a Court of Enquiry.

For many soldiers, Egypt was their first experience of a country outside New Zealand and embodied the exoticism and temptations of the Orient. Clubs such as the Russell Soldiers Home, strategically located in central Cairo, offered more familiar home comforts of <em>&quot;newspapers, magazines, games, writing material&quot;</em>, a refreshment bar and <em>&quot;bright Gospel services on Sundays&quot;.</em>

        From Hornchurch, Percy was sent to Codford Depot to improve his fitness before going back to the front. His health deteriorated and after another spell in Brockenhurst Hospital and then Codford again, he was classified unfit by a Medical Board. Percy embarked for New Zealand on the hospital ship Paparoa on 8 August 1918. <br><br>
He probably attended the illuminated concert in Lymington while at Brockenhurst.</div>

All these organisations perpetuate the comradeship and friendships established during the war, and promote the welfare of ex-servicemen and women and their dependants.
