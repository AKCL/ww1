Dear Edie, 

Well while we were on the march to Germany we did two days’ march then a rest, & if we are not harness cleaning we get the afternoon off to wander about. It seems quite funny to be able to go wherever one likes. This morning a party of the chaps went to Brussels for the purpose of seeing the city, but I am afraid that the safes [cafes?] & nice girls will get a good deal of attention. That is the worst of being a digger, you seem to take on with the girls. Of course who could resist us – Gallant Blue-eyed Anzacs. I should have gone, but 10 francs is no use – so hope to go when money is a bit more plentiful.


I started off with the intention of describing what the marches were like – those that stretch over a fortnight. Of course they have their humourous as well as tedius side.


We left Quievy, a village we had stopped in after the fighting has ceased on the 28th October. It was a miserable cold raw morning & everybody’s temper was not of the best. We tracked for about 5 hours, passing numerous villages destroyed during our advance & came into billets at a village called Ascarmain1. After feeding & watering the horses we got into billets & away we started to make ourselves as comfortable as we could. – trust a digger for that. Now, after coming through the stunt with a whole skin I nearly got killed here. I was getting some wood out of a house when the place fell on me, I can tell you it hurt some, but nevertheless we had a good fire to warm us up.


After being here for 2 days off we started again on a 20 mile march, & it was bitterly cold. We passed through Beaudignies, where 3 weeks before I had gone through with my heart in my mouth on account of Fritz’s heavy shelling. After a heavy day’s march, we got billets at a place called Hon Hargnies & rested for a few days. We spent the time in cleaning harness etc. .


Again we started & more cold weather. This time we passed through Hautmont, a town of fair size. Here Fritz had destroyed the bridges & roads etc.. Didn’t the boys go mad on seeing some nice girl. We got a doss for the night in Furriere-La-Grande2. There were a few French here but as poor as Church mice.

Next morning we were off again – more rain. We followed the stream & for miles the big mills & factories hugged its banks, but alas all was still because the Hun had stolen the machinery & taken it to the Fatherland. The villages had been ruined & all the houses had been robbed of their timber, not one particle of wood being left. On the train line was a long line of trucks full of machinery, farm implements & all kinds of iron etc. ready to be transshipped to Germany.. Some of the C.O.’s in N.Z. can say what they like about the Hun & all the good they have done the world, but the evidence I saw against them was damming. Our planes had bombed him & he could not get off with his illgotten goods.

The next town called [blank] had been rather a fine place, but our bombers had blown up 15 hundred trucks of munitions & also a number of works. Needless to say half the town was badly wrecked. After leaving this town we crossed the border into Belgium & it was very noticeable how all the mills were working & the folk seemed well fed. From what we could see the Hun had not treated the Belgians as he had done the French. That night we rested at [blank]. Six of us were very lucky in getting in with a French family & what a time we had. They could not do enough for us & turned on a feed. We did not like to take it but they were hurt so into it we got & what a time we had!! My knowledge of the French lingo isn’t very advanced but I discovered that I was a bon actor & we got on fine. I think that I shall go on the stage after the fun the natives got out of my endeavour to make them compre.  Next morning we had to kiss the girl and madam ‘goodbye’. The next stop was between [blank] & here we stayed for a few days. We got the afternoon off so had a look about the towns for a decent feed. This is what a chap does after these times.

Off we started again & passed through several big towns including Charleroi. It was Sunday & a most glorious day. The main roads over here are most glorious although the cobbles are a bit rough. In Charleroi all the town turned out to meet us & what a time we had. Now you know that I am an admirer of a pretty face & there were quite a lot of these lovely creatures there. Of course the old married man was as saucy as ever & if the dear little things would smile I simply had to make them. Needless to day they could not resist my gallant manner. The boys played me out but we had a lot of fun. I can tell you that Charleroi is some town, with a population of about 400000 & we boys were all keen to get into town that night, but when we finished up it was 7 kilos away so it was too far after a 20 miles’ march. Well where we were billeted that night I made myself known to a family & what a time I had – nursed the kids & didn’t they turn on a feed too. I tell you my acting took the house by storm & I was some lad. Again the old married man was top dog.  

Next day away we started & finished up at a place called Bossiers3 where we are at present. Yesterday we had the day off so went for a walk about the country side & it is jolly pretty too. There are some fine old homes about here. There is a car running into Namur but – only having 10 francs – I wouldn’t go in. Perhaps better luck next time. 

I will continue this till we get to the Rhine & then send it to you. Keep it & the one I sent to Father so that I can have them when I come home.

Since last writing we have come another kilos & it has rained all the time, but never mind we have had good billets. On the way we have passed large numbers o f Hun guns. I had been told that towards the end the Huns shot their officers at the least thing. Last night two of us got a bed with sheets on & it was fine. The folk would have us have supper with them & what a feed. The Belgians call potatoes – Canada -- & the boy kept saying Canada & I didn’t know what he meant so I said Tres bon so more potatoes & still more till I was blown up like a pup & said I had had enough. Everytime he said Canada I said tres bone – more spuds, but I went to bed with a happy feeling at any rate.

To-day it has rained all the time & a lot of the low country is under water. For miles we followed a stream & once a car used to run along its banks, but Fritz has taken up all the lines for metal etc. One thing very noticeable over here is the way the folk use the animals, cows, etc. All and sundry are used to pull a cart along – sometimes a couple of cows or a horse & a cow or even a dog and a cow.

Dec 19. Well by to-morrow we will be in Germany the land of our foe. Since last writing we have travelled some considerable distance, passing through some of the finest scenery I have ever seen. We have been following the River Meuse & the valley for the last three days & one is struck with the huge factories all along its banks. The banks of the valley are solid rock & with the different colours it is magnificent. One night we stopped in a place called Seraing & just here are the biggest steel works in Belgium, but just at present they are silent because Fritz has stolen all the machinery.

Yesterday a certain number of men were allowed to ride on the tram & I was one of them. I believe one can travel from one end of Belgium to the other by car. Well I got aboard & we went into Liege, then came on to our billets about 7 miles out at a place called [blank] & found they were sleeping in an ex hotel. In the evening we went back into Liege. It is a fair size being on both sides of the Meuse. Well Fritz may have been hard on these folk, but the shops were well stocked, well lit & the folk well dressed, the women in the latest fashion. The town is full of life & all the theatres are going full swing. Soldiers can go wherever they like so we went into all we could see. It makes one a bit homesick to see all these folk dressed in civvies, never mind.

Today we left at 7 a.m. & passed along the valley, following it for miles. On one side ran the river, then  right above us rose the cliff. The road followed the river for miles & some of the homes are beautiful. On the top of the hills rise castles built on solid rock & altogether I have enjoyed it very much. Where we are now the folk are very hostile & I am afraid we will have some fun.

Dec. 21. Well we are in the Hun land & the sooner we are out of it the better. We crossed the border at 2.30 & instead of smiles we got frowns. Some just looked away while others cast their eyes on the ground. The boys had decorated their guns & limbers up with flags etc. We recognize that it must be humiliating for them, but I am afraid we forget all their faults too quickly, yet one cannot be cruel to them. Mind you make them pay up for all they have done. If their reception of us is as rotten as the weather it will be cold.

Last night it snowed & for two hours we drove through a dark forest & I was more than pleased to get in sight of a light. We are billeted at a place called [blank] just over the border. The billet is very cold & it is decent to be by a fire. I got the day off to-day on account of the ‘flu’, but feel a lot better this afternoon. In fact I am almost my old self again. Well we have a few more days to march & then we are in billets & none of the boys will be sorry because of the weather. It is bitterly cold now & I shall end with best love to all from – 

	Your loving brother
