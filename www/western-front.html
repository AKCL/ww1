		<div class="image-label">By 1917, when this handbook for distinguishing between enemy and Allied planes was published, aircraft had developed from flimsy experimental craft into dangerous war machines. The war provided the reason to invest in the technology of aircraft design. Aircraft began by performing reconnaissance and spotting for artillery, but were soon armed with machine guns as fighters.</div>

		<div class="image-label">Although aircraft were the new technology, in 1916 they still co-existed with the older technology of the balloon. This is a view of the Somme battlefield in northern France, after the worst of the battles in 1916. New Zealand troops were in action here in September, capturing Flers and attacking at Morval and Thiepval Ridge. Muirhead Bone, an official British war artist, painted this eerie view of tethered observation balloons above the war-blighted landscape of the Somme in winter.</div>

		<div class="image-label">It may come as a surprise that battlefield tourism emerged so quickly after the war ceased in 1918. This is one of a series of guides to the battlefields issued by Michelin, concentrating on the first Battle of the Somme 1916-1917.
		<br><br>
		This area of Picardy, in northern France, was a fertile agricultural plateau, watered by the river Somme. The guide reports that <em>“the ground was so deeply upturned as to render it useless for agriculture for many years to come…Nearly all the villages were razed, and now form so many vast heaps of débris”</em>

		<div class="image-label">From May to June 1917 Private Hounslow Jackson kept this diary of his experiences in Belgium during the Battle of Messines, which preceded the Battle of Passchendaele. The New Zealand Division was part of the successful attack on the German positions on the Messines ridge on 7 June, but suffered under the bombardment that followed.
		<br><br>
		Private Jackson was a stretcher-bearer and describes the day of 11 June on these pages:
		<em>“20 pst 10am shell still flying round but dont seem to worry now, we are quarter to eleven am we were called on, man wounded it was Stan Carton wounded above the knee with shrapenal a flesh wound…now 11 oclock all by myself he is pumping shells & shrapenal on us there is a sniper at work too…”</em>

		<div class="image-label">Paul Nash was another of the British official war artists. His view of the field of Passchendaele depicts the desolation after the battles of 1917.
		<br><br>
		New Zealanders were heavily involved in this offensive, especially during October 1917. The village of Passchendaele is near the Belgian town of Ypres (now Ieper, and often incorrectly called “Wipers” by the British). New Zealanders successfully took the Gravenstafel Spur, before suffering their worst day ever on 12th October at Bellevue Spur, with the loss of 845 lives out of casualties of about 3700.

		<div class="image-label">The Australian artist Penleigh Boyd enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces in 1915, serving in France until he was gassed in 1917 and invalided out. In the preface to this book of his wartime sketches he says that he <em>“drew chiefly to occupy my time and distract my thoughts during the long hours of rumbling bombardment overhead”.</em>

		This sketch of artillery guns is called “Heavies in action”, and depicts a camouflaged heavy howitzer gun, used to bombard the enemy trenches.

		<div class="image-label">These photographs, appearing in the British newspaper The sphere on 5 August 1916, were taken during a lull in the fighting during the Battle of the Somme.<br><br>
		Taken by official war photographers, they still reveal the testing conditions of trench life and the exhaustion of soldiers under fire. Soldiers rarely spent more than several days at a time in the front line, but the summer conditions of these photographs were considerably better than the rain, mud and snow of winter.
