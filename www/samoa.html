             <div class="label">New Zealand declared war against Germany on 5 August 1914. The following day New Zealand's Governor General, the Earl of Liverpool, received a message from London requiring the occupation of German Samoa and the seizure of the radio communications there. New Zealand responded swiftly with the landing of a Samoa Advance Party of 1385 troops of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, at Apia on 29 August, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Logan and supported by an Australian and French naval presence.
             <br><br>
             The German officials and Samoan general population offered no resistance and the next day Logan proclaimed a New Zealand-run British Military Occupation of Samoa with the lowering of the German flags and seizure of all buildings and properties of the previous administration. The British flag was raised outside the government buildings in Apia on 30 August in the presence of leading Samoan chiefs, general public, officers and troops.
            The occupation of Samoa was New Zealandâ€™s first engagement in the First World War.

            The first transport landing of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force is shown rowing ashore at Matautu Point, just east of Apia on Upolu Island to establish a cover party formed under Major Fulton for the occupation of Samoa.</div>

            <div class="label">When the New Zealand Expeditionary Force landed in Samoa, Private H. F. Bayley of the Fiji Defence Force contingent, which accompanied the New Zealand troops from Fiji to Samoa, hauled down the German flag that flew over the Courthouse in Apia. It was later presented to the New Zealand Government with the request that it be retained in Auckland, probably as a sign of respect, acknowledging the involvement of the 3rd Auckland Regiment in the occupation of Samoa.</div>

            <div class="label">A radiogram arrived on 8 March 1915, ordering the embarkation of 500 men to return to New Zealand. The remainder was to return immediately after the arrival of the Samoan Relief Force expected at the end of the month. 
As the final troopship of the Samoan (NZ) Expeditionary Force headed across the calm moonlit water of the bay and out through the reef entrance, they observed the bonfires lit by the Samoans as a parting tribute to the New Zealanders and were serenaded with the sweet song of farewell, Tofa mai Feleni.</div>
