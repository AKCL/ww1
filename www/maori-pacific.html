     Bloomfield’s illustration captures the fighting provenance of the M&#257;ori and their forefathers, showing their eagerness to engage in battle. M&#257;ori troops were initially commissioned as non-combatants on garrison duty in Malta, but in July 1915 they were re-consigned in to Gallipoli, a combat posting.

     The Niuean and Cook Islanders arrived in Egypt in February 1916 and after training served with the Pioneer Battalion on the Western Front. Within three months, many of the Niueans would be returned home, as the cold and illness overwhelmed them.<br><br>
     The second contingent of Cook Islanders formed the Rarotongan Company and served in the Sinai and Palestine campaigns. They joined the first contingent in France on February 1918.<br><br>
     Approximately 458 Pacific Islanders served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Forces, of which 42 became fatalities.
