		 <div class="label">Felix Graf von Luckner was a German navy officer who earned the nickname “the Sea-Devil” for his exploits while in command of the three-masted sailing ship Seeadler (Sea Eagle) during 1916-1917. Von Luckner successfully waged war without any casualties, making him a heroic figure on both sides of the conflict.</div>

		 <div class="label">Von Luckner believed in destroying cargo rather than taking lives. He was responsible for sinking 86,000 tons of Allied shipping during his 224 days at sea. Von Luckner often achieved his aims by passing the Seeadler off as a merchant ship. However, successful raids did cause logistical issues: at one stage the Seeadler had nearly 300 prisoners on board.<br><br>
		Von Luckner’s raiding career ended when he was captured in Fiji and then taken to a prisoner-of war camp on Motuihe Island, off the coast of Auckland. As part of Von Luckner’s plan to escape the island he staged a Christmas play as a decoy. He left the camp in the commander’s motor boat along with a group of captives. The party then seized the scow Moa with the aim of sailing to the Kermadec Islands. A pursuing ship, the Iris, guessed his likely destination and caught up with him. This photograph shows Von Luckner when he was captured by the crew of the Iris.

		 <div class="label">The battle cruiser HMS New Zealand was given by the country to the Royal Navy in 1909 as an act of patriotic loyalty to the empire. During the ship’s 1913 tour of New Zealand the crew were given many gifts, including a piupiu (grass kilt) and greenstone tiki. Instructions were given that the piupiu and tiki should always be worn in battle by the captain. These instructions were adhered to and were believed to be responsible for the ship's subsequent good luck. HMS New Zealand took part in the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1915, and the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, which was crucial in allowing the allies to maintain their blockade of the German fleet.</div>

		 <div class="label">New Zealand was not subject to any major direct military threat during the war. The country was out of reach of German U-boats, so the only ship to raid local waters was the auxiliary cruiser SMS Wolf. In June 1917 it seized and sank two ships, the Wairuna and an American schooner, off the Kermadec Islands. The 42 crew members of the Wairuna were taken as prisoners. On 18 September 1917 the Port Kembla struck a mine laid by the Wolf and sank off Cape Farewell, without loss of life. Then on 26 June 1918 the trans-Tasman liner Wimmera also hit a mine and sank off the northern tip of New Zealand, killing 26 people.</div>
