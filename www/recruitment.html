     The Japanese defeat of Russia in 1904/5 and the subsequent Anglo-German arms race made New Zealanders uneasy, and were partly responsible for the 1909 Defence Act. This aimed to create a modern New Zealand defence force by introducing compulsory military training for 12 to 21 year-olds (later amended to 14-25 years). By August 1914 some 30,000 men and boys had been trained and equipped under the Act, and were ready to take up arms.<br><br>
     Compulsory military training for boys did have some benefits. Here Cadet Brown is photographed holding his rifle. Adjacent is a silver teapot, apparently awarded in recognition of his superior marksmanship.

     14,000 men volunteered for service within the first week of the war, at an average age of 23. But the voluntary system failed to provide a steady flow of troops, and led to spikes and troughs in numbers.<br><br>
     As the war progressed, there was also a perceived inequality of sacrifice, with some families, regions, classes and occupational groups appearing to contribute greater numbers to the war effort than others. From May 1915 the horrors of Gallipoli and the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em> led to calls for conscription to remove those inequalities.<br><br>
     Conscription was formally introduced by the Military Service Act on 1 August 1916. The first names were drawn under the Act on 15 November 1916, and monthly ballots were repeated for the remainder of the war.

     At the outbreak of war in 1914, volunteers signed up at Defence Department offices throughout the country. In Auckland this meant the Drill Hall in Rutland Street. In March 1916, with volunteer numbers falling, a dedicated recruiting station was erected in a prominent position on the corner of Queen Street and Victoria Street West. In June 1917 it was re-sited in Coburg Place (now Kitchener Street), next to the old Library.

     Opened in February 1916, Featherston Camp accommodated up to 9850 men, and provided advanced training as a supplement to the basic training and musketry instruction received at Trentham Camp. Soldiers were housed in wooden huts, and the camp had its own hospital, churches, bakery, post and telegraph office, club, photographic studio and military outfitters. It also had its own newspaper &#150; the <em>Featherston Camp Weekly : a record of doings in Featherston Military Camp</em> &#150; edited by Aucklander Hector Bolitho.

     Despite its Germanic name, Schmidt Studios in Queen Street was the studio of choice for recruits wanting to have their portraits taken before departing overseas. There are over 4500 surviving glass plate negatives of World War I soldiers in the Schmidt Collection. <br><br>
     Eric Wilson Hames was one of those photographed by Herman Schmidt. After the war he became a Methodist minister, and was principal of the Trinity Methodist Theological College. In 1959, forty years after his return from the Western Front, he set down his reminiscences in a manuscript which he titled <em>How I won the Great War</em>.
