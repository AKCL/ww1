My dear father, 

This is the first day that sufficient energy has been given me to enable me to write you a note. I have been here a week now having come direct from the Peninsula. My knee where I was hit by a piece of shrapnel began to fester and slight sepsis poisoning set in. At the same time I was suffering from Enteritis – one of the last stages of acute dysentery, and a mild form of fever, which is sometimes known as recurring influenza. I am glad to say that I am now on the high road to recovery, the change of diet, and, what is more important, the difference in climate making steady improvement possible. The conditions are so unhealthy on the Peninsula as to be absolutely adverse to the return of good health. The dead are everywhere, the ground we were occupying having been extensively fought over, and many of our men and Turks are only a couple of feet beneath the surface, and when a gusty wind arises, many of the bodies are exposed. Then too, where we constructed out first line of trenches, we were unearthing the dead, and we had to remove their bodies to fresh cemetries. I am only telling you this in order that

you may understand why the fly nuisance is so acute. Flies are no doubt the disseminators of disease, and they are hard at work on the Peninsula, carrying out their crusade. They are absolutely everywhere, and when one eats his food there is a constant series of battles between the flies and the would-be eater. They settle on any liquid food in hundreds and refuse to be driven off. Sometimes we get concentrated milk served out to us, and this is a special favourite of the pest. If the slightest opening is left in the tin they pack themselves in, until it becomes more like a beehive than a tin of milk. When we make our tea, we are often so keen on putting a drop of milk in it, that we laboriously remove the flies, strain the fluid through a piece of cloth. If we put jam on our bread we have to dispute possession with the pest, and they will sometimes cling to the jam even after the owner has put it in his mouth. Now all this is without exaggeration, and if you only believe a portion of it you will readily understand why there is such a terrific amount of sickness at Gallipoli. The authorities thought of trying to keep the sick there in “rest camps”, but the deaths were so many that they soon gave up that plan, and removed the men to Mudros, the bay where the British ships are laying at Lemnos Island.1
In company with six other Aucklanders I left the support trenches last Sunday week, and moved off down

the valley. My knee was very stiff and I found walking difficult. On the way down to the beach we had to call at every dressing station we passed, and at the second to last of these we were labelled up for our future destination. I was first set down for the “rest” camp, but at the English dressing station we were changed and marked for the Island of Imbros. Here an incident occurred which shows how small the world really [is] despite the skepticism of my friend Grist.2 The signature to my label was “Capt. T. G. T. Lovell”. Something about the name struck me as being familiar and although I could hardly conceive of the great pathologist Lovell, the friend of Leonard Hill, as a captain of the Royal Army Medical Corps, I chanced it and asked if he were that personage. He said he was, and asked how I, being a New Zealander had heard of an obscure man like himself. So I told him that Dr Reakes and other bacteriologists in N.Z. had kept him before the public for many years past. He was very pleased and told me that he was still drawing his retainer of ₤5000 a year from Guy’s Hospital. After leaving Capt. Lovell’s station we went on to the base hospital at the beach where we got a drink of beef tea and several biscuits which we appreciated very much. Here we were altered again Mudros being our new port. About 3 o’clock we put out in a navy cutter under slight rifle fire for the hospital ship about two miles west of Anzac. We stayed that night on bought board the “Formosa”.

The next day we went aboard one of the mine sweepers, and made a four hour run to Lemnos, where we found a resting place on board the new hospital ship “Valdivia”. Here we got something good to eat, and also found a New Zealand and a South African nurse. They looked after us and we won’t forget their kindness to us. We rested on the “Valdivia” for two days and again transshipped to the “Janus” an Allan Line steamer. Here we were not so well treated, as it was her first trip as an Hospital ship. For a day or two it was not certain where we were going but once clear of the Aegean Sea, we received orders to proceed to Malta. Arrived here we were met by a number of English ladies who gave us chocolate and drinks. I had not had a shave during the six weeks I was on the Peninsula, and had a beard a couple of inches long, besides a fierce mustache, I am sure I looked far from pretty but the ladies manifested as much interest in us as though we were the darlings of London Society. Several of those who came on our ship have since died in Malta from dysentery and several others are in such a low state that their lives are despaired of. The wounded are mostly doing quite well now. I have not received a line from N.Z. since we left … We only get 2/- a week here and I am awfully short of money as is everybody else.

Hoping that all at home are cheery & happy and sending best love to Mama and my sisters.
Your loving son, Bert.
