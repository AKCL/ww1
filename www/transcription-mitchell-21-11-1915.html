Gallipoli
21 Novbr., 1915

My dear father,
We have just been told that some 80 bags of outward mail went to the bottom of the Aegean Sea in the heavy weather we had the other day. Some say that it was the inward mail that went to the bottom, which if true is sad news for us, since inward mails are so few and far between. I would much prefer that my outward mail should be lost than that yours should not reach me. We can always write letters home at any time (when we do have any time I mean) and doing so is an easy matter and at the least our mails can never be more than a week late in reaching New Zealand. But the loss of the inward mail means a lot to us, especially to fellows situated as I am who have never received a letter since leaving home. It seems hard to understand one’s ill luck in connection with the matter of his mails. Some of the Main Body men have never had a single letter for many months, while men of the 6th reinforcements only a week or two on the Peninsula, have had all the mail due to them.

The weather is changing fast towards winter, and for the past day or two the keen Polar winds, which you should know more of than I do, have been blowing steadily, freezing us almost to the marrow of our bones. For my part the cold has brought on rheumatics in my right leg and knee and so acute was the ache that I slept very poorly, which annoyed me greatly as it was about the first whole night I was getting in bed in my tunnel. The night before I was in my post in the trenches, and the night before that again I was digging on a sap running up to the Apex and the Turkish position. Things were fairly quiet in the trenches although the Turks kept up an intermittent fire which did not trouble me greatly. There was a lot of heavy bombing going on at the apex and the earth was shaken for miles around with the shock. As we were finishing up in the morning a fellow named Sloan and myself had a narrow escape a bullet tearing through the top of the parapet and passing between Sloan and me & one into the back of the trench. In the afternoon I was on a new trench facing snipers Ridge and while having a look at our friend the enemy’s position I chanced on some Australians doing a little sniping. Two Turkish snipers have been posted half way down the slope of Snipers’ Ridge and were doing a lot of damage on the beach. From where we are we are almost right behind them and the Australians were trying to get them out of their position. I went and got my rifle and had a pot or two at them. All we had to fire at was one of their barrels poked out towards the beach and away from us. We must have gone close to them at 700 yards as two or three times their rifles were quickly withdrawn. I do not think we affected them much however as later they shot a donkey which was carrying supplies along the beach. Roughly our respective positions are as below:-

Sergt Billie Wells , who went to school at Onehunga with me was killed in the trenches two days back. He was in the 15th North Auckland and had only returned from hospital about a week before we came from Lemnos. He was in the landing and was wounded in the first rush. He came back and was wounded again on August 6th. It was only the other day that he stopped and asked me if my name was not Mac Mitchell from Onehunga. I could not tell who he was but I remembered him well when he told me who he was. He was teaching up Whangarei way when he enlisted and came over with Main body. He was standing in the sap talking to a friend when a shrapnel shell burst right over his head a bullet entering his head another his heart, killing him instantaneously.

We are now doing one night in the trenches, one on sapping, and the third we are supposed to have in our bivouacs. I may say that we always get the first two, but the third has only occurred twice in a fortnight for me. Still I am standing it very well, although the strain is beginning to tell on us. It is evident that the authorities are expecting anything at all to happen and it was only yesterday that I heard the Brigadier General say that no unnecessary work was to be undertaken. Today therefore we are digging tunnels running down into the earth at an angle of 45 degrees to the plane of our bivvy floor. At the deepest point of the tunnel which will be about 15 feet, we are going to dig a big recess large enough to hold a half company. This recess will be about 25 or 30 ft down in the earth, so that when the Germans get here and bring their big guns to bear on us we will have some chance of getting into the earth and protecting ourselves. From the recess there will be a number of tunnels running into other recesses by means of which we can escape if a shell should land above us. One shell is able to excavate a hole fifteen feet deep and 45 ft. in diameter. There is no one here who is anxious for the Germans to arrive with their big guns, least of all your dutiful son.

I heard the other day that Ernie Sutherland  was going to New Zealand, his nerves being in such a bad state as to make him unfit for further service – at least as far as the firing line goes. Most of the unfit are kept for jobs at the base in Alexandria or Cairo, or if the sound of the bombardments that often taken [sic] place does not affect their nerves, they are brought over and put to work on the beach handling supplies ammunition etc. The fellows on the beach are much better looked after than we are, that is as far as food goes. We are kept on half rations here most of the time and yet have to work two days out of every three for about 10 or 12 hours solidly on pick and shovel. Once or twice when each man has got a slice of bacon about 5 inches long for breakfast there has been a great outcry. Complaints coming in from all hands. It is not much use complaining however as there is no more food to be got, the cooks using every bit of stuff they get from the quartermaster. It is necessary for us to work hard in order to safeguard ourselves, but if we were in Trentham more would be heard of the matter. Some papers in New Zealand advocate sending the men away to be trained, where budding politicians could not interfere but if only we could get the matter of food rations into the hands of say Payne , Isitt  or Webb , we would soon be better looked after. Politicians are still of some use despite the papers..

We expect to go into the trenches on Rhododendron Spur in a few days’ time and will be there for about a fortnight.

Give my best love to Mama my sisters and accept love for yourself.

Your affectionate son
Bert.
