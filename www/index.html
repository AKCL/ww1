           Exhibition from Sir George Grey Special Collections,
            <br>Auckland Libraries</h2>
            <section class="col-1"> 
              <p>When Britain declared war on Germany and its Allies on 4 August 1914, the Dominions of the British Empire, including New Zealand, joined in with patriotic enthusiasm. Many thought the war would not last long and that it would be over by Christmas.  By the time the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, four years had passed and over 100,000 men had served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.</p>
              <p>This exhibition shows New Zealandâ€™s contribution to the First World War, both at the front and at home. With the exception of a few literary works published after the war, everything shown was produced between 1914 and 1919. This is what New Zealanders were reading and looking at as the war continued. </p>
              <p>The exhibition has been curated by the staff of Sir George Grey Special Collections. Unless otherwise noted, all items have been selected from the book, manuscript, map, photograph and ephemera collections found in <a href="http://www.aucklandlibraries.govt.nz/EN/heritage/sirgeorgegrey/Pages/sirgeorgegrey.aspx" target="_blank">Sir George Grey Special Collections</a>.</p>
              <p>We would like to thank the Earwaker family of Dairy Flat and others who prefer to remain anonymous who have kindly lent items to the exhibition.</p>
