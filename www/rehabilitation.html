         <div class="label">The primary role of the army medical services was to help as many soldiers as possible recover fully from wounds and return to their units and fight again.   A small group of New Zealand Medical Corps personnel were attached to each infantry battalion. 
        The wounded might travel through several medical stations -- regimental aid post, advanced dressing station, main dressing station, casualty clearing station, military hospital in France. Hospital ships and ambulance ferries crossed the channel every 2-3 days. Most wounded New Zealanders went to a New Zealand General Hospital then to a New Zealand Convalescent Hospital to complete their recovery and rehabilitation. 
        Those permanently unfit were sent back to New Zealand either on a hospital ship or ordinary troop transport.</div>

         <div class="label">Grey Towers, a large country mansion with 85 acres of grounds, opened as a New Zealand Convalescent Hospital in July 1916. The aim was to return soldiers to the front within six months. The men were given treatment, such as massage, medical electricity and remedial exercise. As well as engaging in physical activities to aid recovery, the men could attend classes, such as bookkeeping, economics, wool-classing, basket-making and construction. <br><br> 
        The men are wearing &quot;hospital blues&quot;, the standard uniform worn by servicemen convalescing in England to distinguish them from civilians and abled-bodied soldiers.</div>

         <div class="label">Walter Fowler of Herne Bay Auckland enlisted in February 1916 and was finally discharged in August 1919. In a letter written to his parents in 1917 he describes his time in France until he was gassed and was &quot;sent over to dear old Blighty, to rest in peace and quiet between delightfully clean sheets&quot;. <br><br>
He recalls an Australian nurse at the hospital at Boulogne, France who was killed when the hospital was shelled a few days after he was there. 
&quot;If ever a good woman died, she did, but she will never be forgotten by the boys for whom she cared. She gave her life for us &hellip; &quot;
Over 500 New Zealand women served overseas in the New Zealand Nursing Service during the war. Ten lost their lives when the British troop transport HMT Marquette was torpedoed by a German U-boat in the Aegean Sea.</div>

        <div class="image-desc">New Zealand had two hospital ships, the Maheno and Marama. Using money raised by public donation the ships were fitted out with operating theatres and wards. By the end of the war, 47,000 patients had been transported aboard the ships. <br><br>
The Maheno went first to Galliopli, then operated in the English Channel taking wounded troops from France to England and made several voyages between the Britain and New Zealand bringing back the wounded. The long sea voyage was often more curative than a hospital stay, and many invalided home returned to fighting later.
