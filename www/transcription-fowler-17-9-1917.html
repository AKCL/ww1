Dear Mother & Father, 
		           
Well on the 23rd of this month I landed in France and so I thought I would try & construct in some sort of a way a short history of how the year was spent. On the Sunday evening we were all lined up before the O.C. & he intended to address but he only opened his mouth when the crowd went mad, hooting & counting him out to their hearts’ content.  We left Sling Camp, arriving at Shorncliffe1 and at 4 a.m. next morning & went to a rest camp till 9 p a.m. where we partook of a little breakfast. From there we marched to Folkestone where we embarked on one of the fast channel steamers. 

Folkestone is perched on up on a hill & it is a big port for the Ostend Mail Boats. We left that port at about 10 x 30 for a long land that we knew nothing about, & about which we were to kno so soon to know so much. We had to put life belts on & keep them on till we arrived at Boulounge. This
Boulogne is rather a big town, and it is on the mouth of a fair sized river. When we arrived there the port was full of ships discharghing

their cargo, the most part being for the army. Little did I think as I crossed the hospital ships to get ashore, than in less than 12 months’ time, I would be lying in a bunk bound for Blighty. 

After a Roll Call, & checking off we at last moved off through the town to the rest camp (called one blanket camp) about 3 miles back. It is right on the top of a big hill, & we were tired out, for it was a steep climb & the sun was very hot. We got a feed & one blanket for the night. The blankets were rather dirty, but better than nothing. Next morning we got a kind of a clean up and then marched off to the station. We were packed into trucks that are used for animals, & what with our clothes we did not have over much room. We went about 2 miles south to a camp called Etaples which is on the coast. 

Well Etaples is a very large camp, there being about 250,000 men under canvas. I was not sorry to get away from this place for there were 9 of us in a tent, & with all our clothes we did not have too much room. When it rained it was not too nice, for we at that time were raw & not seasoned. You don’t know how keen the boys are to get away from this place, & I was glad when we got on board train bound for the front. I have told you how we got lost for 4 days; nobody seemed to want us or know anything about us, or where we were needed. Instead of going up into the Somme, we

landed in Rouen. M

My word France is a pretty country in places, & though we had to put up with a lot of inconveniences, we enjoyed ourselves very much. One thing that struck me forcibly was the tremendous amount of traffic on the lines leading to the Somme. We were in one spot for 6 hours without moving an inch, and as far as we could see there were trains waiting like we were. At last we arrived at a place about 4 miles back from Albert2. We got out of the train &sat round a bit of a fire till about 7x30 a.m., when we got a lift on a waggon up to Fricourt3. Now, when going up to this place we got our first impressions of the terrible wastage of war, & also the huge & wonderful organisations  there is when a big push is on. For miles there were enormous Ammunition Dumps, & also barbed wire, food stores, & everything that one could mention. Well we passed troops moving up to the firing line to replace those coming out for a spell. This Fricourt was once a thriving village, but what we saw of it was a heap of bricks, and opposite it was King George’s Hill where I saw some wonderful trenches & dugouts. We had mined under the German Hun’s trenches & blown an enormous hole under him, and we had also blown his trenches to pieces.

From there I was sent up to first Brigade Hqrs., to report, and we had to go over about 4 miles of shell torn

ground, dotted here & there with some object to mark the last resting place of some poor chap who had made the greatest sacrifice. I could write all day & then I could not describe the awful desolation that greeted our eyes. After walking for about under a sweltering sun for about 1½ hours we struck a road, & it was here that we first got our baptism of shell fire. It appears that on that morning a Taube taube4 had flown over & had observed the heavy traffic on the road, so he had decided to shell it & he put 3 or 4  over near the road, pieces of H.E. penetrating the cover of a motor lorrie behind which we were hiding. Well we boys were like a lot of girsl girls, all asking the guide questions, for we were not over joyful
We then cut off the road & followed up a track leading past some big howitzers and smaller field guns, to the famous Fish Alley, a trench that the Maori made a record in building. While passing While passing, one of these guns fired a round, & I could not go another step for it had given me such a shock. We went down the trench for about four or five hundred yards, reported to Head H.Qrs Hqrs. The first man I met was Lieut. Geddes5, of the firm of Brown Barrett & Co., and from there I was posted to the 15th Howitzer Battery.

When we reported Capt. Miles6 asked us if we were trained signallers, and I answered “Yes sir”. “Oh” he said, “I am pleased for most of my men staff have fallen been killed or wounded”. “Oh,”thought I, “a nice mess I have got myself

into through being too keen but I came through alright. We went into a dug-out to have some tea, and it is only on a battlefield that one can appreciate what kindness is. The boys do not have too much, yet they could spare a bit of bread & steak for us, and we enjoyed it. All the time old Fritz was shelling Fleurs7, about 300 yards away, where a number of 6 Guns were concealed, and I, being new & raw, kept looking out to see how near they were falling.

At 7x30 the O.C. told us that we would have to go down to the horse lines for the night. We left the dug-out & ran across an open space for about 200 yards to the limbers, for Fritz was shelling the spot. We hopped aboard & off we started for home. Now the road was perhaps once a highway, but at the time it was a shell torn track along which were scattered dead horses & men, and waggons & limbers. Believe me, one minute you would be hanging on for dear life, in fear that you would be thrown out into onto the road. You see it was blown to pieces through the hun shelling it all time, for it was the main road through to the front line. When we were coming down it  were we were blocked up for about half an hour, much to my disgust, as the lun hun was pumping shells ahead of us, and had got a team of horses, killing h ar a man, and wounding 2 others. We got out of the place after a while, & I have never seen such  T  R  A  F  F  I  C , as was on this road.

6.
I have seen over four miles of traffic hung up as long as four hours. We arrived at the lines about 11x30 pm and spent the night under the stars. Next day we built a dug-out, and I never stayed to enjoy the object fruit of my labors, for that evening I went up to the guns. 
I  was up there for about 3 weeks & there I learnt the joys of soldiering, and I often thought that there was not much glory in it when I had to walk about for a week without any sole on my boot. Then, when we vere were being shelled we had to keep low, never knowing when we would go West. The last night in the Somme we slept in the open, with mud up to one’s nech neck. Next morning we were up at 4 am. packing up & getting ready to more move off at 6 a.m. I never got any breakfast that morning, & was wet through & covered with mud. But we were all happy to move out from the Somme. We travelled about 13 thirteen days, going through some pretty country, but at the time we were not in the mood to enjoy the scenery, for we were tired out & wet to the skin the whole time. In all we travelled about 80 miles & were not at all sorry when we settled down in a place for a decent period. We slept in some queer places & it was great of an evening to see the boys having a look for a louse lice. One cannot

7.
One cannot describe the pleasure of we derived when we had a bath – the first for about 6 weeks. We had rather a quiet time at (can’t make out word)----Fler.. and at Christmas time8 I went off to a school of instruction. We had a lot of fun there, but what put a damper on us all was the awful cold. When off duty not a we used to go into town &have a feed. While at the school I swung the lead for over over a week, & we chaps used to cut up everything for firewood.

The mud When I went back never dried up & consequently our feet are were always cold except when in bed for our boots are were always wet. In the morning the boots were so hard that a hammer would have made no impression on them. The moisture used to get frozen in them & we used to have to work them over the fire before we could get our feet into them. 

When I went back to the battery we had some fine weather, but still awfully cold. About the 16th of Feb., we shifted out and went back for about 10 days’ rest; and then we were shifting about in Armentieres helping the Australians in their raids. From there we went to Hill 639 & were there about a month. And wasn’t it cold? I often wonder how one enited existed when on duty at the Obers Observation Post. Still we had a lot of fun and every night we would fill in the time by playing cards

8.
The biggest trouble was the mud, for it bogged a man & it needed almost a team of horses to pull us out.

From there we went out to Lombrea for 14 days’ r training, & had it not been so cold & muddy we would have enjoyed ourselves very much. While out training my chum & I decided to swing the lead, and so, after a most miserable night spent on horse picq line picket our minds were made up. We had been tramping through mud, putting on horse covers, hardly distinguishable from the mud, for from 2 till 6 a.m. So we both went into bed. When the doctor came round he saw us & wanted to know what was the matter. “Got a cold sir” we said, and so we managed to get 3 days in bed. Not bad!

The weather changed when we left & we had most delightful weather from the middle of April up till I left the line on the 9th of June.
We took two days coming back, and we enjoyed it very much indeed, for going out we had to drive through a snowstorm, and so intense was the cold that one could not undo his hands from the articles he was holding on to.

9.
Arriving back on Sunday, we all spent the night at the wagon lines & next day some of the boys went up to the position we were taking over. Now the night before old Fritz had noticed the tommies pulling out, & our guns going in, so next morning he put over about 100 shells into the little plantation where our guns were concealed. He blew up the cookhouse & the W,C. but otherwise did no harm. The next day I went up to the guns and went on to O.P. duty. The spot where we were was just behind the famous Ploughstreet10 & it was a pretty spot. Now the hun could see all our preparations going on, for the pushlines for light railways were being laid, and huge amounts of ammunition were being stored for future use. Barbed wire, iron, tools & sandbags, & a dozen & one things for the advance. Seeing all this, & the rows & rows of gun pits for the guns to come into, he used to shell all the place very heavily, his favourable dodge being about 5 am. & about 9x30 p.m.  I have stood & watched him shelling different batteries & have wondered how ever the chaps escaped. managed to escape.

One night he went mad & shelled all our gun positions. Six of us boys  were sleeping in a canvas hut & the noise was something awful. I do not know how we managed to come through

10.
the night. At any rate we were all as scared as could be but none said a word, not wanting anyone to know his feelings. However we moved into a house next day. Things were a bit warm all the time we were there. After about 3 weeks we moved over to Hill 6311. My word we had to work when we got there &most of the evenings were spent in wearing gas masks. This meant no sleep proper rest. We were shelled all the time, and I am in no hurry to go through it all again. When one of the boys was going on leave  & I gave him For 10 days Fritz had been  sending over gas shells & we never got more than 3 hours sleep a night sleep. One evening he chased up us away from the guns, so bad was the gas. Well I did not go bu Being a signaller I did not go, but the gunners did.

Now on the Wednesday morning night we got news that the boys were going over the top in the morning so I went to bed as I had to go on duty in the trenches at 2.30 am. the next morning. No sooner did I get into bed than over came the gas shells, & never stopped till it was time for me to go on duty; so no sleep. One the way to the O.P. Fritz put over some more shells & as I fell into a hole I pulled off my mask. I must have got a little gas then, but

11. 
got the big lot at 7 a.m. Well old Fritz was still shelling us at 3 a.m., but at 10 past 3 we sent up 19 mines under him. That was the greatest sight I have ever seen. Great sheets of flame shot hundreds of feet in the air, and the earth trembled some. Then off went the guns. And what a row! It took him by surprise for you never saw such a number of S.O.S. sign lights in all your life. So great was his surprise that we lost only one life in capturing his trench. I saw everything. The tanks, the cavalry, and the boys taking his trench. But we lost when he counter attacked yet it proved that N.Z boys are second to none, and Mr Fritz could not capture any of his old trenches. He threw a lot of big shells about by our battery, killing one man & wounding two. I myself had a lucky escape for as I tumbled into a ditch for safety a big piece of shell cut my pants at the knee.

By this time, I was feeling pretty so bad & that I lay down all the afternoon and as I was no better the next day I was sent away & put through several casualty clearing stations & then put on the train for Boulogne. I was there for 3 days & then sent over to Blighty dear old Blighty, to rest between in peace & quiet between delightfully clean sheets. But I have occasion to remember the hospital at Boulogne.

12.
the pain. While lying there the pain was so awful that an Australian nurse came up & stroking my brow said “Well laddie, how are you?”. I could not answer her for I was so weak & in such pain. Afterwards when I told her of the pain in my left side & stomach, she gave me something & then gave me a cup of hot milk, sitting down beside me while I drank it. About 4 days after the Germans shelled the hospital & she was killed. If ever a good woman died, she did, but she will never be forgotten by the boys for whom she cared. She gave her life for us – “Greater love hath no man than to lay this, that he lay down his life for his friends.”

Well now I think I have told you all I can remember of France & how I reached England. You have read of how in my letters how I fared in hospital & on leave. Although I will be glad to get home to dear old Auckland I must say that in one way I don’t regret joining the forces, for I have had some fun &enjoyed myself very much in England, making good friends wherever I have been.
Before I end I must say that I am thankful to God for His great love to me in preserving me from all the dangers that have 13 surrounded me. Perhaps some day I will be able to tell you more that will interest you, but at present I must end with love from

Your loving son
Walter
